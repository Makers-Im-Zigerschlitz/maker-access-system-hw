Idea
----
The idea of this project is to create a management system for makerspaces.
So it should be possible to manage the members and their permissions.
The members can learn the needed stuff in courses. After they did the course, they will be able to use the device.

So on example if you want to use the 3D-Printer, you have to do a 3D-Printer-Course. After you did that the admin can allow you to use the 3D-Printer.
Everytime you want to use the printer, you have to authorize yourself with an RFID-Tag. The Arduino will check your permissions and allow the usage if you did the course.

Please refer to the WebService-Repo for further information
